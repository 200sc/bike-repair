Bike repair game

Think CookServeDelicious
Play each day, people come in with requests
	either
		1. Do repair on the spot or
		2. Schedule repair to be finished by some later day
	some repairs take a long time or a lot of focus, and some days will be busier than others
	people will come in and say when they would like it done by after first few levels

open times are 9-9 weekdays, 10-6 weekends
busy times are 3-8 weekdays, 11-2 and 4-6 weekends
1 hr = 1 minute? 
	so 12 minute levels or 8 minute levels
	   5 minutes busy      5 minutes busy (split up)

repair minigames:
	1. fill up tire
		screw off cap
		alternate push key and release key with good spacing
		target certain pressure level (too high pressure pops tube)
		screw on cap before it goes below pressure (not a problem on some tubes)
		[[this can be made easier by buying faster / constant pumps]]
	2. flat tire
		(8) take wheel off bike
		(3) take tire off rim
		(4) replace tube in tire
		(5) patch tire
		(6) put tire back on rim
		(9) put wheel back on bike
		(1) fill up tire
	3. take tire off of wheel
		if tire is inflated, (7) deflate tire
		hold down a few buttons to grip	tire
		release in order to pull tire off
	4. replace tube in tire
		hold two keys to keep tire open
		mash key to pull old tube out
		mash key to put new tube in
		release hold keys
	5. patch tire
		[[to ask: do you ever patch tires or just tubes?]]
		if tube, can partially inflate to hear holes
		alternate two keys to rotate tire till problem(s) is found
		if hole, clean, sand, patch	
		if nail/object, remove, clean, sand, patch
		[[this applies to tubes, not tires, if you don't patch tires]]
		[[the same minigame but just removing things would apply to tires]]
		[[maybe there's a difficulty setting that would change whether or not the game 
		  tells you if you've found all the holes]] 
		[[alternatively tire can be replaced]]
	6. put tire back on
